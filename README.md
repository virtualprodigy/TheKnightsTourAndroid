# TheKnightsTourAndroid
This is my Knight's Tour project. I'm recycling code from an old college project to bring the Knight's Tour into a new light.
I'm going to be adding in a graphic representation of The Kinght's Tour. This project is something I've wanted to do for a while and I'll be slowly adding some cool things to this project.
