# TheKnightsTourAndroid
This is my Knight's Tour project. I'm recycling code from an old college project to bring the Knight's Tour into a new light.
I'm going to be adding in a graphic representation of The Kinght's Tour. This project is something I've wanted to do for a while and I'll be slowly adding some cool things to this project.

#Change Log
###Version 1.0
 1. Initial upload

###Version 2.0
 1. This version includes a graphic representation of the knight moving across the chessboard
 2. There are two issues I'll be creating a branch to fix them.
    1. The Knight is rendered upside down
    2. The thread may crash on exit as I hasn't aded the proper code to stop it
